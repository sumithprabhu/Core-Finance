# Developer FAQs

## 1. **What is Blitz Protocol?**
Blitz Protocol is an indexing and querying protocol built for the **EDU Chain** blockchain. It helps developers interact with on-chain data more efficiently by providing fast, structured querying through APIs and indexed subgraphs.

---

## 2. **How do I create a Blitz?**
To create a Blitz, you use the **Playground** feature of Blitz Protocol. You provide your protocol name and smart contract details, and with just a few clicks, your contract is deployed and ready for indexing.

---

## 3. **What types of smart contracts are supported?**
Currently, Blitz Protocol supports smart contracts deployed on the **EDU Chain**. As Blitz evolves, it will support a broader range of blockchains.

---

## 4. **Do I need to write code to use Blitz Protocol?**
Not necessarily. The **Playground** is a no-code tool that allows you to create and deploy smart contracts without writing any code. However, for more complex custom queries and contract setups, a basic understanding of smart contract coding may be required.

---

## 5. **What is indexing in Blitz Protocol?**
Indexing refers to the process of capturing and storing blockchain events emitted by smart contracts in a structured way. Blitz Protocol does this automatically for contracts deployed on the EDU Chain, making the data available for fast and efficient querying.

---

## 6. **What is the difference between querying and indexing?**
**Indexing** is the process of capturing data and making it searchable. **Querying** is the process of retrieving specific information from that indexed data based on parameters.

---

## 7. **Can I query multiple smart contracts simultaneously?**
Yes, Blitz Protocol allows you to query multiple contracts and even aggregate data across them using custom subgraph APIs.

---

## 8. **What are subgraphs in Blitz Protocol?**
Subgraphs are custom APIs that allow developers to extract and query data from the blockchain. Subgraphs index data from smart contract events, enabling complex queries that would otherwise be inefficient or impossible.

---

## 9. **How does Blitz Protocol handle large amounts of data?**
Blitz optimizes storage by indexing only relevant events and metadata, making it highly efficient for querying large amounts of data in real time.

---

## 10. **Can I query Blitz Protocol using GraphQL?**
Yes, Blitz Protocol uses GraphQL APIs for querying indexed blockchain data. This allows developers to craft complex queries with ease.

---

## 11. **What is the EDU Chain Testnet?**
The **EDU Chain Testnet** is the blockchain currently supported by Blitz Protocol for testing and development. It allows developers to create and test smart contracts without incurring real transaction costs.

---

## 12. **Is Blitz Protocol fully decentralized?**
Not yet. Blitz Protocol is designed with decentralization in mind but is currently operating in a semi-centralized model. Full decentralization is part of its future roadmap.

---

## 13. **How do I deploy a contract on Blitz Protocol?**
You can use the **Playground** to deploy your contract. You input your contract details, and the system handles the deployment on the EDU Chain.

---

## 14. **What programming languages are supported?**
Blitz Protocol primarily interacts with contracts written in **Solidity**. However, any language that can compile to Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) bytecode is supported.

---

## 15. **Is there support for querying historical data?**
Yes, once a contract is indexed, Blitz Protocol allows you to query both current and historical data related to the contractâ€™s events and transactions.

---

## 16. **How do I troubleshoot a failed transaction?**
If a transaction fails during deployment, Blitz Protocol provides error handling and logs, which you can view to determine the cause. Common issues include incorrect contract addresses or invalid ABI.

---

## 17. **Can I add my own custom subgraphs?**
Yes, Blitz Protocol allows developers to create and deploy custom subgraphs to index the specific data points they need from their smart contracts.

---

## 18. **How do I get started with Blitz Protocol?**
You can get started by visiting the **Playground** and creating your first Blitz. Detailed documentation is available on the official website to guide you through the process.

---

## 19. **What are some use cases for Blitz Protocol?**
Blitz Protocol is ideal for dApps that need to access complex, real-time data such as DeFi projects, NFT platforms, and blockchain games that require dynamic querying capabilities.

---

## 20. **How can I contribute to Blitz Protocol?**
Blitz Protocol is an open ecosystem. You can contribute by creating subgraphs, suggesting features, or even helping improve the protocol. You can find more details on contributing in the official documentation.
