# About Blitz Protocol

Blitz Protocol is a indexing and querying protocol specifically designed for the **EDU Chain** blockchain. While currently in its early stages, Blitz Protocol is on a mission to evolve toward a fully decentralized model, enabling efficient data querying across blockchain networks.

Blitz Protocol makes it easy for developers to query and interact with blockchain data, paving the way for the next generation of decentralized applications (dApps). By solving key issues around data indexing and querying, Blitz is revolutionizing how we access on-chain data.

## What is Blitz Protocol?

Blitz Protocol is a lightweight, blockchain-based protocol aimed at making blockchain data queryable and indexable in a decentralized manner. It is **not yet fully decentralized** but is designed with decentralization in mind, with plans to scale across different chains.

Blitz Protocol will ultimately support various blockchain platforms, starting with the **EDU Chain Testnet**.

## How Does It Work?

Blitz Protocol simplifies complex queries into structured, efficient queries using a combination of **APIs** and **indexed subgraphs**. Here’s how it functions:

1. **Data Input**: Applications interact with smart contracts on the **EDU Chain**, where events are emitted.
2. **Blitz Indexing**: Blitz Protocol’s indexing system captures these events and stores them in a manner that can be queried quickly.
3. **Query Handling**: Developers and applications can issue queries to access indexed blockchain data using the Blitz API.

### Why Use Blitz Protocol?

Without an indexing protocol like Blitz, blockchain developers face significant challenges in accessing and querying blockchain data. Typically, direct interactions with smart contracts only allow for basic data retrieval.

Blitz Protocol makes it possible to perform **more complex queries**, including:

- Aggregating data across multiple events
- Searching for specific contract addresses
- Filtering data based on specific conditions

Blitz handles these tasks efficiently, offering developers a robust and scalable solution for blockchain data queries.

## Future Vision

As Blitz Protocol grows, we aim to decentralize our infrastructure, and provide more robust developer tooling to make blockchain querying even more seamless. We are actively working on building a developer ecosystem around Blitz, fostering collaboration, and pushing the boundaries of what blockchain querying can achieve.
